NEAT is a clustering framework including road network aware algorithms for clustering trajectories of mobile objects traveling in road networks (MO trajectories).

To deliver MO trajectory clustering results of high quality, NEAT takes into account the characteristics of both the underlying road networks and MO trajectories.
